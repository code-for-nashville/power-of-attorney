# Power of Attorney

A Power of Attorney form for immigrants at risk of deportation.

This project was bootrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  Check out [the Create React App User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for a complete list of commands, how-tos, and FAQs.

## Background

Immigrant parents may face detainment or deportation with little warning. Since parents may work in the same location or be in the same location when picked up by ICE/immigration, their children can be left without any legal guardian. When picked up by ICE/Immigration, parents are often unavailable or inaccessible for days or weeks (and can even be deported before ever having access to their children or family). Parents can sign a power of attorney for the minor children to give guardianship of their child to someone they trust, which takes effect only if they are detained or deported.

This app provides a streamlined form with fields specifically tailored to immigrants being detained or deported.

## Design

The designs for this project are available on [Zeplin](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5adb2c9f32cffe0d11d2de86). Contact the current maintainer for access to the Zeplin project.

## Installation

Make sure you have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) and a recent version of [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.  Clone this repository, and run `yarn start` to start the dev server.

Check out the [Create React App User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for additional commands.

## Custom Commands

We've added a few commands that don't come out-of-the-box for Create React App.

### `yarn watch-css`

Watches changes to your sass files for development.

### `yarn build-css`

Compiles sass files into css for production

## Styling

This project is built with [Grommet](http://grommet.io/), and ships with a custom [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) Grommet theme in  `styles/grommet/`.

SCSS file will be automatically watched and built when you run `yarn start`.  The built `.css` output will have the same filename and live in the same directory as it's `.scss` counterpart.  Make sure to import the `.css` output in JavaScript files, not the raw `.scss`.  Create React App is not configured to import `.scss`.

## Partners
